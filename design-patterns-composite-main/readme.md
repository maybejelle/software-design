# Composite design pattern
The composite design pattern is usually used in hierarchical structures, think for instance in Filesystems, UIComponents,...
This pattern is easy to use and can be good for managing items in tree structures. In this demo i made some UIComponents that can be nested.


The power of this pattern is that Some UI components can add and remove stuff, and some don't, but they all still follow the principles described in the UIComponent interface


## some useCases
I already talked about tree structures, but when you want to dynamically arrange hierarchical data, this is also perfect to use.
